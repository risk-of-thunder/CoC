# Code of Conduct
### Code of Conduct of the Risk of Rain 2 Modding Community

The following guidelines apply to all packages submitted to the Risk of Rain 2 community on Thunderstore. They may be added to or modified in the future.

### Malware

- Do not upload packages containing malware.
- Packages must not deceptively disrupt or damage other software and hardware.

### NSFW

- All packages containing NSFW content must have the "Contains NSFW content" option selected when uploaded.
- Packages must not contain unlawful content.

### Copyright and Licensing

- Copyright laws and code licensing must be followed where applicable.
- Do not distribute game files such as the original game's Assembly-CSharp.dll.

### Compatibility and the Ecosystem

- Do not obfuscate mods. This makes it difficult to audit malicious behavior as well as fix incompatibilities.
- Do not abuse features such as BepInIncompatibility to prevent mods that would otherwise function with your mod without issue. Do not try to circumvent this by purposely creating unncessary incompatibilities.
- Do not place advertisements or donation links on the main menu or other menus where it would become a problem if many mods did the same. If they are necessary, please place them in an unobtrusive place that can be shared with other mods.

### Spam

- Do not reupload exact duplicates of existing packages.
- Where possible, make mods configurable rather than upload multiple packages with different configurations.

### Harassment and Abuse

- Do not upload packages with the intent to harm a group or individual.
